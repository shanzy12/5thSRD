# Dissonant Whispers
_1st-level enchantment_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain.
Target must make a Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far away as its speed allows.
The creature doesn't move to dangerous ground, such as a fire or pit.
On a successful save, target takes half damage and doesn't have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.

At higher levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, damage increases by 1d6 for each slot above 1st.
